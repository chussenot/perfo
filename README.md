**A TCP, UDP, and SCTP network bandwidth measurement tool**

A network can be a weird place, with ever-changing asymmetric paths moving bits  
from one place to another. Sometimes this leads to very different throughput  
performance between servers that appear to be otherwise identical.  
After running a few common utilities like traceroute—or perhaps curl on an HTTP  
service—you are still unable to replicate the problem.
